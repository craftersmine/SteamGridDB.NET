# Contributing

So, you want to help improve this app? That is fantastic, you are a _wonderful_ person, thank you! Given that I this is a
spare-time project, I can use all the help I can get.

## Bugs and Feature Requests
1. Report bugs in the [Issues](https://github.com/craftersmine/SteamGridDB.NET/issues) section. Please explain your bugs as best you can. The best way is to write steps-to-reproduce (STR) which explains step by step how to make the bug happen. Bugs without such a reproduction might not be fixable. If your bug is a crash, please include a logs of your application or stacktraces. 

2. Ask for features in the [Issues](https://github.com/craftersmine/SteamGridDB.NET/issues) section too. Keep in mind that while I personally cannot add everything - I have to constrain my own workload around features I myself will have a use for - perhaps there's another kind person who will be able to add it?  

3. Give _productive_ feedback. Read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/craftersmine/SteamGridDB.NET/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and adhere to it. Remember I'm not selling you anything, I don't owe you anything. Whether you use my product is completely up to you. Meaning; if you're rude your post will quite simply be ignored.

## Pull Requests
Since I cannot possibly do everything myself, I will certainly accept pull requests - but I must ask that you follow a few ground rules. This is so I can keep control of the repository, and to help prevent you wasting your time on work that I will reject.

1. **Remember that many users will be inexperienced both with IDEs and coding**. It's very important that your feature is easy to use.  

2. Please _ask me_ before starting work on a larger contribution. I have the final say in what I want added. I can tell you if what you want to add will be rejected outright and I really don't want you to waste your time, it's too valuable for me. You can either ask via an [Issue](https://github.com/craftersmine/SteamGridDB.NET/issues).  

3. I recommend not trying to do a pull request unless you already have a bit of experience in coding. This isn't any kind of requirement though, if your addition isn't too large you might get some help finishing.  

4. Remember that I will have to review your work. Anything you can do to help that process will be appreciated.  

5. Expect criticism.  

6. Read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/craftersmine/SteamGridDB.NET/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and adhere to it.
